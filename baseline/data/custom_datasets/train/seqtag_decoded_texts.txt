Premise
the embolization group had a shorter median duration of hospitalization than the surgical group ( 1 day vs . 5 days , p < 0 . 001 ) and a shorter time before returning to work ( p < 0 . 001 ) .

Premise
at 1 year , symptom scores were better in the surgical group ( p = 0 . 03 ) .

Premise
during the first year of follow - up , there were 13 major adverse events in the embolization group ( 12 % ) and 10 in the surgical group ( 20 % ) ( p = 0 . 22 ) , mostly related to the intervention .

Premise
ten patients in the embolization group ( 9 % ) required repeated embolization or hysterectomy for inadequate symptom control .

Premise
after the first year of follow - up , 14 women in the embolization group ( 13 % ) required hospitalization , 3 of them for major adverse events and 11 for reintervention for treatment failure .

Claim
in women with symptomatic fibroids , the faster recovery after embolization must be weighed against the need for further treatment in a minority of patients .

Claim
therapy of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should provide symptom relief and improve quality of life ( qol ) because most patients are symptomatic at baseline .

Claim
red blood cell transfusion achieving hb level above 10 g / dl might contribute to the improvement of the kps and qol seen in patients with agc .

Claim
