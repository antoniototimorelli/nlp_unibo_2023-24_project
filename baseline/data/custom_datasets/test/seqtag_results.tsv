the differences in tumor response ( 35 . 5 and 46 . 5 % for ge and gp , respectively ) were not significantly different .	16020979	Premise
median time to disease progression ( 33 . 8 and 40 . 7 weeks , respectively ) and overall survival ( 41 . 4 and 57 . 3 weeks , respectively ) were of borderline significance in favor of the gp arm ( p = 0 . 055 ) .	16020979	Premise
this toxicity profile of ge is similar to gp ,	16020979	Claim
but the apparent inferior efficacy may discourage further investigation	16020979	Claim
after the rehabilitation program , cancer survivors ( n = 63 ) displayed statistically significant improvements on health - related quality of life with effect sizes ( es ) varying from 0 . 38 to 0 . 99 ( rand - 36 ) and from - 0 . 34 to - 0 . 57 ( rscl ) , most persistent at 3 - month follow - up .	16125515	Premise

a multidimensional rehabilitation program has statistically and clinically relevant beneficial effects on health - related quality of life , exercise capacity , and muscle force in cancer patients with different diagnoses .	16125515	Claim
if offered the choice , the majority of cancer survivors seem to prefer multidimensional programs to programs with only one component .	16125515	Claim
evidence suggests that the re - entry phase ( ie , early period after medical treatment completion ) presents distinct challenges for cancer patients .	16135469	Claim
in analyses controlling for study site and baseline depressive symptoms , vid produced significant improvement in energy / fatigue at 6 months relative to ctl , particularly among women who felt less prepared for re - entry at baseline .	16135469	Premise
no significant main effect of the interventions emerged on cancer - specific distress ,	16135469	Premise
but edu prompted greater reduction in this outcome relative to ctl at 6 months for patients who felt more prepared for re - entry .	16135469	Premise
between - group differences in the primary outcomes were not significant at 12 months ,	16135469	Premise

patients in the standard treatment group showed a greater decline in trial outcome index ( toi ) scores ( physical well - being , functional well - being and breast cancer concerns subscales in fact - b + 4 ) and recovered more slowly than patients in the snb group ( p < 0 . 01 ) .	16163445	Premise
the change in total fact - b + 4 scores ( measuring global qol ) closely resembled the toi results .	16163445	Premise
18 months post - surgery approximately twice as many patients in the standard group compared with the snb group reported substantial arm swelling ( 14 % versus 7 % ) ( p = 0 . 002 ) or numbness ( 19 % versus 8 . 7 % ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) .	16163445	Premise
there was no evidence of increased anxiety amongst patients randomised to snb ( p > 0 . 05 ) .	16163445	Premise
for 6 months post - surgery younger patients reported less favourable qol scores ( p < 0 . 001 ) and greater levels of anxiety ( p < 0 . 01 ) .	16163445	Premise
in view of the benefits regarding arm functioning and quality of life , the data from this randomised study support the use of snb in patients with clinically node negative breast cancer .	16163445	Claim
erlotinib was superior to placebo for survival , progression - free survival , and tumor response rate .	16166415	Claim
exploratory analyses indicate that epidermal growth factor receptor status may be an important predictor of the erlotinib survival effect .	16166415	Claim
rash ( 75 % versus 17 % ) and diarrhea ( 54 % versus 18 % ) in the erlotnib and placebo group respectively were the most common adverse events .	16166415	Premise
severe rash occurred in 9 % and severe diarrhea in 6 % of erlotinib - treated patients and each resulted in study discontinuation in 1 % of patients .	16166415	Premise
dose reductions were required for 10 % of patients with rash and 4 % of patients with diarrhea .	16166415	Premise
of group 1 patients 67 % had gynecomastia compared with 8 % in group 2 and 34 % in group 3 .	16280763	Premise
breast pain was more frequent in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3 ( 58 % vs 7 % and 30 % , respectively ) .	16280763	Premise
differences were significant between groups 1 and 2 ( or 0 . 12 p < 0 . 001 ) , and groups 1 and 3 ( or 0 . 52 p < 0 . 01 ) .	16280763	Premise
in patients in group 1 who had gynecomastia or breast pain a significant decrease in symptoms was achieved in those receiving tamoxifen ( p < 0 . 05 ) .	16280763	Premise
treatments were well tolerated in the 3 groups .	16280763	Premise
no differences in qol between groups 2 and 3 were found .	16280763	Premise
at a median followup of 26 months we observed 12 biochemical relapses .	16280763	Premise
gynecomastia and breast pain induced by bicalutamide monotherapy after rp can be prevented and treated .	16280763	Claim
tamoxifen has been shown to be more effective and safe than rt in this setting .	16280763	Claim
qol and sexual function are not negatively influenced by these 2 treatment options	16280763	Claim
axillary clearance in early breast cancer aims to improve locoregional control and provide staging information	16344321	Claim
in both the patients ' subjective assessment of their ql and the physicians ' perception of the patients ' ql , the largest adverse ql effects of ax were observed from baseline to the first postoperative assessment ,	16344321	Premise
but the differences tended to disappear in 6 to 12 months .	16344321	Premise
at a median follow - up of 6 . 6 years , results for sx + ax and sx yielded similar dfs ( 6 - year dfs , 67 % v 66 % ; hazard ratio [ hr ] sx + ax / sx , 1 . 06 ; 95 % ci , 0 . 79 to 1 . 42 ; p = . 69 ) and os ( 6 - year os , 75 % v 73 % ; hr sx + ax / sx , 1 . 05 ; 95 % ci , 0 . 76 to 1 . 46 ; p = . 77 ) .	16344321	Premise
avoiding axillary clearance for women > or = 60 years old who have clinically node - negative disease and receive tam for endocrine - responsive disease yields similar efficacy with better early ql .	16344321	Claim
fatigue has a significant impact on the quality of life ( qol ) of cancer patients .	16462503	Claim
most of scores indicated less fatigue ( higher score ) in the standard treatment group ,	16462503	Premise
but there were no statistically significant differences found at baseline and weeks 4 , 8 , and 27 except for sds at week 8 ( p = 0 . 018 ) with less patients reporting significant fatigue in the standard treatment arm .	16462503	Premise
for the entire participant population , fatigue levels initially worsened with radiotherapy , stabilized at week 8 , and returned to baseline by week 27 .	16462503	Premise
radiotherapy initially caused a worsening of fatigue but with time fatigue levels returned to baseline	16462503	Premise
clinically , this structured multidisciplinary intervention had no impact on fatigue ,	16462503	Claim
there was the suggestion the multiple sessions may have contributed to worse fatigue during active cancer treatment .	16462503	Claim
differences in mean qol change scores from baseline to study end for epoetin alfa versus bsc were 3 . 17 points for the fact - general total , 9 . 90 for the fact - an fatigue subscale , and 7 . 30 for the fact - an anemia subscale .	16476840	Premise
this was equivalent to corrections in qol deficits attributable to epoetin alfa of 97 . 3 % , 40 . 7 % , and 38 . 0 % for the fact - general total , fact - an fatigue , and fact - an anemia subscale scores , respectively , versus bsc .	16476840	Premise
a somewhat greater qol benefit was observed for the fact - an fatigue and fact - an anemia subscales in the subset of patients with baseline hb levels > 10 . 5 g / dl .	16476840	Premise
early treatment with epoetin alfa to correct anemia improved qol in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful way , and improvements were greater in patients with baseline hb levels > 10 . 5 g / dl .	16476840	Claim
significantly fewer epo patients than bsc patients with initial hb levels > 9 . 7 g / dl to < or = 12 . 1 g / dl required transfusions .	16476841	Premise
epo maintained hb levels throughout the study for patients with hb levels > 11 . 3 g / dl to < or = 12 . 1 g / dl , compared with a decrease with bsc .	16476841	Premise
qol declined in patients receiving bsc ,	16476841	Premise
the mean decreases in qol scores were greater for bsc patients with baseline hb levels > 10 . 5 g / dl , compared with the overall bsc group .	16476841	Premise
in patients with cancer receiving platinum - based chemotherapy and with baseline hb levels > 10 . 5 g / dl , early intervention with epo reduces transfusions , maintains hb level , and maintains or improves qol .	16476841	Claim
this study supports the positive effects of early intervention when analyzed according to initial hb value .	16476841	Claim
the response rate was 35 . 7 % vs . 43 . 8 % ( p = 0 . 4 ) , median ttp was 4 . 7 months vs . 5 . 5 months ( p = 0 . 6 ) , one - year survival rate was 38 . 5 % vs . 58 . 6 % ( p = 0 . 07 ) in the nl and np groups , respectively .	16483488	Premise
grade i - ii neuro - sensory toxicity occurred significantly more frequent in nl group than in np group ( 68 . 4 % vs . 36 . 4 % , p = 0 . 0017 ) .	16483488	Premise
however , grade i - ii granulocytopenia was significantly less occurred in nl group than in np group ( 49 . 4 % vs . 70 . 6 % , p = 0 . 037 ) .	16483488	Premise
there was no statistically difference between the two groups regarding quality of life .	16483488	Premise
due to good efficacy and tolerability , the nl regimen offered a new candidate for treating advanced nsclc .	16483488	Claim
the observer - based toxicity scoring system used by dahanca ( the danish head and neck cancer study group ) has proved itself sensitive to differences in toxicity in a large randomised study ,	16524633	Claim
but like other toxicity scoring systems it has not been formally validated .	16524633	Claim
the dahanca toxicity scores had a low sensitivity ( 0 . 48 - 0 . 74 ) in detecting equivalent subjective complaints from the questionnaires and the observer - based scoring system severely underestimated patient complaints .	16524633	Premise
a specific patient group where the dahanca score had a higher tendency to fail could not be detected .	16524633	Premise
the dahanca toxicity score is an effective instrument in assessing objective treatment induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients but insensitive and non - specific with regard to patient assessed subjective endpoints .	16524633	Claim
this weakness seems inherent in an observer - based scoring system , and will probably also apply to newer ones like ctcae 3 . 0 .	16524633	Claim
no statistically significant difference in qol response between treatment arms was found for any domain or item except nausea and vomiting ( p = 0 . 04 ) .	16823511	Premise
cross - sectional comparisons showed statistically significant differences for some domains / items at specific assessment times with all differences favoring the dox alone arm .	16823511	Premise
patients on dppe / dox arm were significantly worse in terms of average and median pain change scores .	16823511	Premise
in general , the qol analyses were concordant and showed that patients on dox alone had fewer disease and treatment related adverse events and better qol .	16823511	Claim
interestingly , the qol response analysis also showed that aggressive premedication regimens appear to ameliorate potential negative effects of dppe on emesis and nausea as measured by patient assessed qol .	16823511	Claim
targeted therapies may improve chemotherapy effectiveness without worsening toxicity .	16934909	Claim
le ( y ) is an attractive target since it is expressed by most nsclc .	16934909	Claim
patients on arms a and b had median survivals of 31 . 4 and 25 . 3 weeks , 12 - month survivals of 29 % and 24 % , and 18 - month survivals of 18 % and 8 % , respectively	16934909	Premise
toxicity was mild in both arms .	16934909	Premise
sgn - 15 plus docetaxel is a well - tolerated and active second and third line treatment for nsclc patients	16934909	Claim
there was a significant decrease in pad use in group a .	16942833	Premise
after 16 wk , 39 patients versus 27 were dry ( p = 0 . 007 ) .	16942833	Premise
at 20 wk , 4 wk after planned interruption of duloxetine , we observed a u - turn , 23 patients were completely dry in group a versus 38 in group b ( p = 0 . 008 ) .	16942833	Premise
whereas , after 24 wk , 31 in group a versus 41 in group b were dry ( p = 0 . 08 )	16942833	Premise
the data suggest that combination therapy might provide another treatment option for sui in men that might increase the percentage of early postsurgery continence .	16942833	Claim
as with previously published results at 2 years , there was no statistically significant difference in the trial outcome index of the fact - b , the primary endpoint of the study , between treatments at 5 years .	16944295	Premise
there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in es total scores .	16944295	Premise
diarrhea ( anastrozole 3 . 1 % vs . tamoxifen 1 . 3 % ) , vaginal dryness ( 18 . 5 % vs . 9 . 1 % ) , diminished libido ( 34 . 0 % vs . 26 . 1 % ) , and dyspareunia ( 17 . 3 % vs . 8 . 1 % ) were significantly more frequent with anastrozole compared to tamoxifen .	16944295	Premise
dizziness ( 3 . 1 % vs . 5 . 4 % ) and vaginal discharge ( 1 . 2 % vs . 5 . 2 % ) were significantly less frequent with anastrozole compared to tamoxifen .	16944295	Premise
in this , the first report of hrqol over 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor , we conclude that anastrozole and tamoxifen had similar impacts on hrqol , which was maintained or slightly improved during the treatment period for both groups .	16944295	Claim
overall survival was longer with dcf versus cf ( 23 % risk reduction ; log - rank p = . 02 ) .	17075117	Premise
two - year survival rate was 18 % with dcf and 9 % with cf .	17075117	Premise
overall response rate was higher with dcf ( chi2 p = . 01 ) .	17075117	Premise
grade 3 to 4 treatment - related adverse events occurred in 69 % ( dcf ) v 59 % ( cf ) of patients .	17075117	Premise
frequent grade 3 to 4 toxicities for dcf v cf were : neutropenia ( 82 % v 57 % ) , stomatitis ( 21 % v 27 % ) , diarrhea ( 19 % v 8 % ) , lethargy ( 19 % v 14 % ) .	17075117	Premise
complicated neutropenia was more frequent with dcf than cf ( 29 % v 12 % ) .	17075117	Premise
adding docetaxel to cf significantly improved ttp , survival , and response rate in gastric cancer patients , but resulted in some increase in toxicity .	17075117	Claim
incorporation of docetaxel , as in dcf or with other active drug ( s ) , is a new therapy option for patients with untreated advanced gastric cancer .	17075117	Claim
breast symptoms increased for both groups during radiotherapy , without loss of strength or range of movement .	17143593	Premise
the incidence of lymphedema during the study was low for both groups and did not differ between groups .	17143593	Premise
the pectoral stretching program did not influence the outcomes measured because the symptoms reported by patients were not a consequence of contracture .	17143593	Premise
the body image and cosmesis scores of female patients were significantly higher in the lrp group than in the orp group ( body image , 17 . 4 vs 14 . 9 ; cosmesis , 19 . 1 vs 13 . 0 , respectively ) .	17522936	Premise
the female patients in the orp group had significantly lower body image scores than the male patients ( 14 . 9 vs 18 . 3 ) .	17522936	Premise
this study is the first to show that orp has a negative impact on body image and cosmesis as compared with lrp .	17522936	Claim
functional outcome , qol , and morbidity are similar for the two approaches .	17522936	Claim
the advantages of a long - lasting improved body image and cosmesis for this relatively young patient population may compensate for the longer operating times and higher costs , particularly for women .	17522936	Claim
depression , anxiety , fatigue , and impaired wellbeing are common , important , and closely related in advanced cancer .	17548243	Claim
sertraline had no significant effect ( scale , benefit over placebo [ 95 % ci ] ) on depression ( ces - d 0 . 4 [ - 2 . 6 to 3 . 4 ] ) , anxiety ( hads - a 2 . 0 [ - 1 . 5 to 5 . 5 ] ) , fatigue ( fact - f 0 . 3 [ - 4 . 3 to 4 . 9 ] ) , overall quality of life ( fact - g 1 . 7 [ - 1 . 3 to 4 . 7 ] ) , or clinicians ' ratings ( sqli 2 . 0 [ - 2 . 5 to 6 . 5 ] ) ,	17548243	Premise
sertraline was discontinued more often and earlier than was placebo ( hazard ratio 1 . 46 [ 1 . 03 - 2 . 06 ] , p = 0 . 03 ) .	17548243	Premise
however , at the final analysis in july 2006 of all patients ( n = 189 ) and with longer follow - up , survival did not differ significantly between the treatment groups ( unadjusted hazard ratio 1 . 35 [ 0 . 95 - 1 . 91 ] , log - rank p = 0 . 09 ; adjusted hazard ratio 1 . 27 [ 0 . 87 - 1 . 84 ] , cox model p = 0 . 20 ) .	17548243	Premise
sertraline did not improve symptoms , wellbeing , or survival in patients with advanced cancer who do not have major depression , and should be reserved for those with a proven indication .	17548243	Claim
recently , the treatment of advanced gastric cancer by continuous infusion of 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) with low - dose cisplatin ( cddp ) has improved efficacy without severe toxicities .	17550132	Claim
the possible effectiveness of 5 - fu + low - dose cddp for colorectal cancer ( crc ) is intriguing .	17550132	Claim
the response rate in the 5 - fu + low - dose cddp arm ( n = 75 ) was significantly higher than that in the 5 - fu arm ( n = 77 ) ( 25 . 3 % vs . 11 . 7 % ; p = 0 . 037 ) .	17550132	Premise
there was no significant difference in the median overall survival time between the 5 - fu + low - dose cddp arm and the 5 - fu arm ( 479 and 491 days , respectively ) .	17550132	Premise
grades 3 / 4 toxicities occurred infrequently in both arms .	17550132	Premise
the quality of life was almost the same between the arms	17550132	Premise
low - dose cddp improved the response rate while keeping toxicities within clinically acceptable limits .	17550132	Claim
however , this combined treatment did not confer a survival advantage over treatment with continuous infusion of 5 - fu alone for patients with far - advanced crc ; that might be attributable to the short cddp administration setting of 12 weeks .	17550132	Claim
when combined hormone therapy ( n = 2196 ) was compared with placebo ( n = 2189 ) , there was a significant increase in the number of major cardiovascular events ( 7 v 0 , p = 0 . 016 ) and venous thromboembolisms ( 22 v 3 , hazard ratio 7 . 36 ( 95 % ci 2 . 20 to 24 . 60 ) ) .	17626056	Premise
there were no statistically significant differences in numbers of breast or other cancers ( 22 v 25 , hazard ratio 0 . 88 ( 0 . 49 to 1 . 56 ) ) , cerebrovascular events ( 14 v 19 , 0 . 73 ( 0 . 37 to 1 . 46 ) ) , fractures ( 40 v 58 , 0 . 69 ( 0 . 46 to 1 . 03 ) ) , and overall deaths ( 8 v 5 , 1 . 60 ( 0 . 52 to 4 . 89 ) ) .	17626056	Premise
hormone replacement therapy increases cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk when started many years after the menopause .	17626056	Claim
