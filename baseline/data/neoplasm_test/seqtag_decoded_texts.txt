Premise
the total number of hot flushes decreased from a mean of 79 . 4 ( sd 37 . 4 ) per week before the procedure to a mean of 49 . 9 ( sd 39 . 9 ) per week during the first 2 weeks after the procedure ( p = 0 . 0002 ) .

Premise
the total number of hot flushes continued to decrease over the remaining follow - up period ( weeks 3 - 12 ) , and stabilised at a mean of 8 . 1 ( sd 5 . 6 ) per week ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .

overall , patients assigned to receive stress management training did not report significantly less psychological distress on the medical outcomes study 36 - item short form ( sf - 36 ) mental component summary scale than did those assigned to usual care .

Premise
patients with above - average levels of psychological distress ( scores < or = 50 ) who were randomly assigned to the intervention condition reported significant improvement in their distress compared with those assigned to usual care only on the sf - 36 mental health subscale and the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale .

Claim
this study found that self - administered stress management training is effective only in those radiotherapy patients with initially higher levels of psychological distress .

Claim
within this study , a geriatric liaison intervention based on frailty for the prevention of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour has not proven to be effective .

Premise
efficacy was similar for the 250 - and 500 - mg / d groups .

Premise
objective tumor response rates were 18 . 4 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 11 . 5 to 27 . 3 ) and 19 . 0 % ( 95 % ci , 12 . 1 to 27 . 9 ) ; among evaluable patients , symptom improvement rates were 40 . 3 % ( 95 % ci , 28 . 5 to 53 . 0 ) and 37 . 0 % ( 95 % ci , 26 . 0 to 49 . 1 ) ; median progression - free survival times were 2 . 7 and 2 . 8 months ; and median overall survival times were 7 . 6 and 8 . 0 months , respectively .

drug - related toxicities were more frequent in the higher - dose group .

Premise
withdrawal due to drug - related aes was 1 . 9 % and 9 . 4 % for patients receiving gefitinib 250 and 500 mg / d , respectively .

Claim
gefitinib showed clinically meaningful antitumor activity and provided symptom relief as second - and third - line treatment in these patients .

Claim
at 250 mg / d , gefitinib had a favorable ae profile .

Claim
gefitinib 250 mg / d is an important , novel treatment option for patients with pretreated advanced nsclc .

Claim
octreotide , the long acting somatostatin analogue , improves survival of animals with pancreatic cancer .

Premise
the patients treated with octreotide showed a significant advantage in quality of life ( restored appetite , improvement of digestion and intestine function , remission of abdominal pain and preservation of baseline body weight ) with a mean > 80 of karnofsky performance score .

Premise
whereas neoplasm grew according to an almost exponential trend in untreated patients

Premise
karnofsky performance score was particularly high in both patients .

Claim
octreotide therapy seems to confer a survival benefit and a better quality of life in advanced pancreatic tumour .

Premise
responses ( > or = 50 % improvement ) were seen in 3 ( 20 % ) of 15 patients with an initial dose at 6 . 5 mg / m ( 2 ) per day ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 0 % - 40 % ) , 15 ( 54 % ) of 28 patients at 300 mg / m ( 2 ) per day ( 95 % ci , 35 % - 72 % ) , and 10 ( 67 % ) of 15 patients at above 300 mg / m ( 2 ) per day ( 95 % ci , 43 % - 91 % ) .

Premise
the rate of progressive disease was 47 % , 21 % , and 13 % at the same dose levels , respectively .

Premise
eight ( 73 % ) of 11 patients crossing over from 6 . 5 mg / m ( 2 ) per day to higher doses subsequently responded .

Premise
the median duration of response from start of therapy could not be estimated for the 15 patients at 300 mg / m ( 2 ) per day owing to low relapse rates in 2 patients ( 13 % ) ; at higher doses it was 516 days .

Premise
the following drug - related adverse effects were reversible and treatable : hypertriglyceridemia ( 46 patients [ 79 % ] ) , hypercholesterolemia ( 28 patients [ 48 % ] ) , headache ( 27 patients [ 47 % ] ) , central hypothyroidism ( 23 patients [ 40 % ] ) , asthenia ( 21 patients [ 36 % ] ) , and leukopenia ( 16 patients [ 28 % ] ) .

Premise
pancreatitis occurred in 3 patients with triglyceride levels higher than 14 . 69 mmol / l ( 1300 mg / dl ) , all of whom were taking 300 mg / m ( 2 ) or more of oral bexarotene per day .

Claim
bexarotene ( targretin capsules ) ( the first retinoid x receptor - selective rexinoid ) was well tolerated and effective as an oral treatment for 15 ( 54 % ) of 28 patients with refractory or persistent early - stage cutaneous t - cell lymphoma at doses of 300 mg / m ( 2 ) per day .

Claim
hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism require monitoring but are reversible and manageable with concomitant medication .

Premise
of the 103 participants , overall qol at week 4 was maintained by the patients in the intervention ( n = 49 ) , whereas qol at week 4 significantly decreased for patients in the control group ( n = 54 ) .

Premise
this change reflected a 3 - point increase from baseline in the intervention group and a 9 - point decrease from baseline in the control group ( p = . 009 ) .

Premise
intervention participants maintained their qol , and controls gradually returned to baseline by the end of the 6 - month follow - up period .

Claim
thus , a structured multidisciplinary intervention can help maintain or even improve qol in patients with advanced cancer who are undergoing cancer treatment .

Premise
significantly fewer patients receiving escitalopram developed depression ( 24 . 6 % in the placebo group vs 10 . 0 % in the escitalopram group ; stratified log - rank test , p = . 04 ) .

Premise
the hazard ratio of 0 . 37 ( 95 % ci , 0 . 14 - 0 . 96 ) demonstrated an advantage of escitalopram ( p = . 04 ) .

Premise
patients undergoing radiotherapy as the initial modality were significantly more likely to develop depression than those undergoing surgery ( radiotherapy compared with surgery group ; hazard ratio , 3 . 6 ; 95 % ci , 1 . 38 - 9 . 40 ; p = . 009 ) .

Premise
patients in the escitalopram group who completed the study and were not depressed rated their overall quality of life as significantly better for 3 consecutive months after cessation of drug use .

Claim
in nondepressed patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer , prophylactic escitalopram reduced the risk of developing depression by more than 50 % .

Claim
these findings have important implications for the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer .

Premise
partial response rates were 40 and 41 . 7 % in iep and mvp arms .

Premise
median survival durations were 5 . 9 and 8 . 1 months for the iep and mvp chemotherapy arms , and 4 . 1 months for bsc ( log - rank test : p = 0 . 0003 ) .

Premise
one year survival was 13 , 29 . 8 and 39 . 3 % for the bsc , iep and mvp regimens , respectively .

Premise
two years survival was 7 . 8 , 6 . 4 and 13 . 1 % for the bsc , iep and mvp regimens , respectively .

Premise
improvement in quality of life ( qol ) scores at the first , second and third interview were seen in chemotherapy arms only , not in the bsc arm .

combination chemotherapy improves the quality of life as well as prolonging the survival of patients with advanced nsclc .

Claim
low anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis prevents a definitive stoma in patients with distal rectal cancer .

Premise
problems with continence for liquids or gas occurred less frequently in the colonic j - pouch group 6 months after surgery .

Premise
the frequency of bowel movements was lower in the j - pouch group ( 2 . 5 per day ) than in the coloanal group ( 4 . 7 per day ) .

Claim
the colonic j - pouch was superior with regard to continence for gas and liquids compared with a straight coloanal anastomosis .

Claim
we speculate that the advantage of the colonic j - pouch is not in the creation of a larger neorectal reservoir but rather may be related to decreased motility .

Claim
the postoperative complications of ( campos ls , limberger lf , stein at , kalil an ) laparoscopic radical hysterectomy are similar to those in abdominal radical hysterectomy .

Premise
four patients ( 25 % ) in the lrh group and 5 patients ( 36 % ) in the arh group presented with transoperative or serious postoperative complications .

Premise
all of the transoperative complications occurred in the lrh group .

Premise
the relative risk of presenting with complications was 0 . 70 ; ci 95 % ( 0 . 23 - 2 . 11 ) ; p = 0 . 694 .

Premise
lrh group mean pain score was significantly lower than arh after 36 h of observation ( p = 0 . 044 ; mean difference score : 1 . 42 ; 95 % ci : 0 . 04 - 2 . 80 ) .

Claim
lrh provided lower pain scores after 36 h of observation in this series .

Premise
using an area under the serum concentration - time curve analysis , there was no evidence that methylphenidate , as compared with placebo , improved the primary end point of cancer - related fatigue in this patient population ( p = . 35 ) .

Premise
however , a subset analysis suggested that patients with more severe fatigue and / or with more advanced disease did have some fatigue improvement with methylphenidate ( eg , in patients with stage iii or iv disease , the mean improvement in usual fatigue was 19 . 7 with methylphenidate v 2 . 1 with placebo ; p = . 02 ) .

Premise
there was a significant difference in self - reported toxicities ( sed ) , with increased levels of nervousness and appetite loss in the methylphenidate arm .

Claim
this clinical trial was unable to support the primary prestudy hypothesis that the chosen long - acting methylphenidate product would decrease cancer - related fatigue .

Premise
the cronbach ' s alpha coefficients were 0 . 79 and 0 . 73 for the body image and fear of recurrence scales , respectively .

Premise
significant benefit in body image and satisfaction with treatment was observed in the bct patients .

Premise
no significant difference was observed in fear of recurrence between the two groups .

Premise
ratings of cosmetic results decreased with time , in line with clinical observations of long - term side - effects of radiotherapy .

Claim
wide excision appeared to be the most important predictive factor for poor cosmetic result .

Claim
in this multicentre randomised study , bct helped to maintain the patients ' body image , resulted in higher satisfaction with treatment and yielded no significant difference from mrm with respect to fear of recurrence .

Premise
compared with surgical excision , the total treatment costs of mms are significantly higher ( cost difference : primary bcc , 254 euros ; 95 % confidence interval , 181 - 324 euros ; recurrent bcc , 249 euros ; 95 % confidence interval , 175 - 323 euros ) .

Premise
for primary bcc , the incremental cost - effectiveness ratio was 29 , 231 euros , while the ratio for recurrent bcc amounted to 8094 euros .

Premise
the acceptability curves showed that for these ratios , the probability of mms being more cost - effective than surgical excision never reached 50 % .

Claim
at present , it does not seem cost - effective to introduce mms on a large scale for both primary and recurrent bcc .

Claim
it is possible that mms may become a cost - effective treatment for recurrent bcc .

Premise
secondary outcome improvements resulting in significant between - group contrasts favoring the mbsr group at 4 months included meaningfulness , depression , paranoid ideation , hostility , anxiety , unhappiness , and emotional control .

Premise
results tended to decline at 12 months and even more at 24 months , though at all times , they were as robust in women with lower expectation of effect as in those with higher expectation .

Claim
the mbsr intervention appears to benefit psychosocial adjustment in cancer patients , over and above the effects of usual care or a credible control condition .

Claim
the universality of effects across levels of expectation indicates a potential to utilize this stress reduction approach as complementary therapy in oncologic practice .

Premise
patients receiving sunitinib reported higher fksi - 15 and fksi - drs scores at each cycle than those receiving ifn - alpha , with a significant difference in the overall least squares means ( 3 . 27 and 1 . 98 , respectively ; p < . 0001 ) .

Premise
differences in least squares means for fact - g ( and all subscales ) , eq - 5d index , and eq - vas were all significantly favorable for sunitinib ( p < . 01 ) .

Claim
sunitinib provides superior qol compared with ifn - alpha in mrcc patients .

Premise
male sexual dysfunction was significantly increased following surgery ( p < . 001 ) ,

Premise
although there was no difference between treatment arms .

Premise
both treatment groups reported similar levels of decreased physical function at 3 months ,

Premise
but thereafter it returned to baseline levels .

Premise
there was no evidence of any major changes between treatments or time points in terms of general health or bowel function ,

Premise
but exploratory analysis indicated a significant ( p = . 006 at 2 years ) increase in the level of fecal incontinence with pre .

Claim
these results from a large randomized trial using validated patient - completed questionnaires show that , for males , the main adverse effect was sexual dysfunction , and the main cause of this was surgery ,

Claim
pre also affected sexual and some aspects of bowel functioning .

Premise
cbt was associated with mean reductions in wakefulness of 55 minutes per night compared with no change in tau .

Premise
standardized relative effect sizes were large for complaints of difficulty initiating sleep , waking from sleep during the night , and for sleep efficiency ( percentage of time in bed spent asleep ) .

Premise
there was no significant interaction effect between any of these outcomes and baseline demographic , clinical , or sleep characteristics .

Claim
cbt for insomnia may be both clinically effective and feasible to deliver in real world practice .

Premise
alopecia , arthralgias / myalgias , and cardiac events were significantly less frequent with ppx / carboplatin , whereas grade > or = 3 neutropenia and grade 3 neuropathy showed a trend of worsening .

Premise
there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions despite the absence of routine premedication in the ppx arm .

Premise
overall survival was similar between treatment arms ( hazard ratio , 0 . 97 ; log rank p = 0 . 769 ) .

Premise
median and 1 - year survival rates were 7 . 9 months and 31 % , for ppx versus 8 months and 31 % for paclitaxel .

Claim
ppx / carboplatin failed to provide superior survival compared with paclitaxel / carboplatin in the first - line treatment of ps 2 patients with nsclc ,

Claim
but the results with respect to progression - free survival and overall survival were comparable and the ppx regimen was more convenient .

Premise
transfusion - free ( p = . 0012 ) survival and transfusion - and severe anemia - free survival ( p = . 0001 ) were significantly greater in the epoetin beta group versus placebo ( wald chi ( 2 ) test ) , giving a relative risk reduction of 43 % and 51 % , respectively .

Premise
the response rate was 67 % and 27 % in the epoetin beta versus the placebo group , respectively ( p < . 0001 ) .

Premise
after 12 and 16 weeks of treatment , qol significantly improved in the epoetin beta group compared with placebo ( p < . 05 ) ;

Premise
this improvement correlated with an increase in hb concentration ( > or = 2 g / dl ) .

Claim

an initial analysis of this immature data has suggested that the results in these patients may be different to those obtained in patients with m1 disease .

Claim
' casodex ' 150 mg is less effective than castration in patients with m1 disease .

Claim
' casodex ' has shown a benefit in terms of quality of life and subjective response when compared to castration and has an acceptable tolerability profile .

Premise
at the time of 3 weeks after surgery , the reflux and dyspnea scores were higher in whole stomach group than in narrow gastric tube group , which meant that the patients in whole stomach group suffered more severe problem .

Premise
at the time of 6 months and 1 year after surgery , the reflux scores were lower in narrow gastric tube group than in whole stomach group , which revealed that there were less problems of reflux in the patients of narrow gastric tube group ;

Premise
the score of physical function scale in narrow gastric tube group was higher conversely , which suggested that the patients gain a better status in physical function .

Premise
nausea and vomiting is the only notable symptom that was worse in whole stomach group at the time of 2 years after surgery ,

Claim
narrow gastric tube reconstruction may be a good alternative choice for patients undergoing oncologic esophagectomy in view of better health - related quality of life after the surgery .

Premise
for the de gramont , lokich , and raltitrexed groups , respectively , median survival was 294 , 302 , and 266 days .

Premise

Premise
an increase in treatment - related deaths was seen on raltitrexed ( de gramont one , lokich two , raltitrexed 18 ) due to combined gastrointestinal and haematological toxicity .

Claim
the degramont and lokich regimens were similar in terms of survival , quality of life , and response rates .

Claim
the lokich regimen was associated with more central line complications and hand - foot syndrome .

Claim
raltitrexed showed similar response rates and overall survival to the de gramont regimen and was easier to administer ,

Claim
but resulted in greater toxicity and inferior quality of life .

Premise
compliance rates for the eortc questionnaires were acceptable at 72 % - 93 % of eligible patients out to the 12 - month assessment .

Premise
systemic side effect ( se ) change scores were significantly improved for tch - treated patients compared with ac→th and ac→t at eoc , suggesting improved tolerability .

Premise
physical functioning ( pf ) was only slightly worse at midpoint for those receiving tch , compared with patients who were just starting on taxane in an ac→th regimen , but was otherwise similar between arms .

Claim
hrql outcomes for adjuvant docetaxel and trastuzumab - based regimens are favorable and support tch as a more tolerable treatment option .

Premise
participants in the ppdi intervention demonstrated significant ( p < . 05 ) reductions in adverse dietary symptoms and significant improvements ( p < . 05 ) in functional status , performance status , dietary intake , adherence to dietary guidelines , dietary knowledge , and satisfaction with the intervention as compared with the control group over time .

Claim
the ppdi was an effective dietary intervention for patients undergoing a gastrectomy for gastric cancer and deserves additional study in other populations of patients .

Claim
incorporating patients ' perspectives into a dietary intervention after gastrectomy for gastric cancer may contribute to improved patient outcomes and quality care .

Premise
twenty - three ( 7 . 4 % ) died within 24 months of surgery .

Premise
no significant difference was observed in the complications among the 4 groups .

Premise
there was no difference in bowel function between the cp - 1 and sa groups .

Premise
other parameters were not statistically different .

Premise
qol scores at 24 months were similar for each of the 4 groups .

Claim
in patients undergoing a restorative resection for low rectal cancer , a colonic jp offers significant advantages in function over an sa or a coloplasty .

Claim
in patients who can not have a pouch , coloplasty seems not to improve the bowel function of patients over that with an sa .

Claim
combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy after surgery , compared with postsurgical radiation therapy alone , has been shown to improve disease - free survival and overall survival significantly among patients with poor - prognosis ( i . e . , advanced stage disease or metastasis to regional lymph nodes ) resectable rectal cancer .

Claim
however , the combined therapy is associated with more toxic effects , raising the question of whether the benefits of the treatment justify its quality - of - life costs for the individual patient .

Premise
as reported previously , the combined therapy reduced the risk of relapse by 34 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] = 12 % - 50 % ; p = . 0016 ) and reduced the overall death rate by 29 % ( 95 % ci = 7 % - 45 % ; p = . 025 ) in comparison with adjuvant radiation therapy alone .

Premise
in the 5 years following assignment to treatment , patients who received the combined therapy had more time with toxicity ( 3 . 1 months ; 95 % ci = 2 . 0 - 4 . 1 months ) , shorter survival after relapse ( 3 . 6 months less ; 95 % ci = 0 . 9 - 6 . 3 months less ) , and more twist ( 6 . 1 months ; 95 % ci = 0 . 2 - 12 . 0 months ) than patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy alone .

Claim
despite an increase in the amount of time that individuals spent with early and late toxic effects , the q - twist analysis indicated that the combined therapy conferred significantly greater benefit for a wide range of patient preferences about living with the toxicity of treatment or the symptoms of overt disease .

Claim
use of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with poor - prognosis resectable rectal cancer is justified ,

Claim
the q - twist method is an excellent way to compare treatment outcomes that include quality - of - life considerations .

Premise
the ni group had statistically smaller deteriorations in weight ( p < 0 . 001 ) , nutritional status ( p = 0 . 020 ) and global qol ( p = 0 . 009 ) compared with those receiving uc .

Premise
clinically , but not statistically significant differences in fat - free mass were observed between the groups ( p = 0 . 195 ) .

Claim
early and intensive ni appears beneficial in terms of minimising weight loss , deterioration in nutritional status , global qol and physical function in oncology outpatients receiving radiotherapy to the gi or head and neck area .

Claim
weight maintenance in this population leads to beneficial outcomes and suggests that this , rather than weight gain , may be a more appropriate aim of ni .

Premise
participants in the intervention group reported , on average , 53 fewer days of sick leave over the first 6 months post - surgery than those in the control group ;

Premise
however , this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0 . 122 ; 95 % confidence interval - 15 . 8 , 122 . 0 ) .

Premise
no statistically significant differences were found for secondary outcomes .

Premise
interviews with trial participants indicated that trial procedures , including recruitment , randomisation and research instruments , were acceptable .

Claim
conducting a pragmatic trial of effectiveness of a vr intervention among cancer survivors is both feasible and acceptable ,

Claim
but more research about the exact components of a vr intervention and choice of outcomes to measure effectiveness is required .

Premise
the mean time to neutropenia resolution was longer with iv g - csf [ 7 . 9 days , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 6 . 6 - 9 . 1 ] compared with sc g - csf ( 5 . 4 days , 95 % ci 4 . 6 - 6 . 2 ) , log - rank p = 0 . 001 .

Premise
longer neutropenia duration was observed in all patient subgroups ,

Premise
except for patients undergoing autologous hct .

Premise
there was no significant difference between groups in the occurrence of infection or death ,

but more deaths were observed with iv ( 4 / 57 , 7 % ) versus sc ( 1 / 61 , 1 . 6 % ) g - csf administration , p = 0 . 196 .

Claim
bolus iv administration of g - csf results in longer neutropenia duration than sc administration , with no difference in clinical or quality - of - life measures .

Claim
fatigue has a significant impact on the quality of life ( qol ) of cancer patients .

Premise
most of scores indicated less fatigue ( higher score ) in the standard treatment group ,

Premise
meaningful differences in aerobic fitness between the exercise and usual care groups at both the 8 - week [ mean 3 . 0 ml kg ( - 1 ) min ( - 1 ) ( 95 % ci - 1 . 1 - 7 . 0 ) ] and 3 - month follow - up [ 2 . 1 ml kg ( - 1 ) min ( - 1 ) ( - 2 . 3 - 6 . 6 ) ] were found ,

Premise
although these differences did not achieve statistical significance ( p values > 0 . 14 ) .

Premise
self - reported physical activity increased in the exercise group ( eg ) compared to the usual care group at both 8 - week ( p = 0 . 01 ) and 3 - month follow - up ( p = 0 . 03 ) and significant differences in favour of the eg were found for physical well - being at both the 8 - week ( p = 0 . 03 ) and 3 - month follow - up ( p = 0 . 04 ) .

Premise
improvements in fatigue ( p = 0 . 01 ) , total quality of life plus fatigue ( p = 0 . 04 ) , and a composite physical functioning score ( p = 0 . 01 ) at the 3 - month follow - up were also found .

Claim
the peach trial suggests that 8 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise training was feasible and may improve aerobic fitness , fatigue and quality of life in de - conditioned cancer survivors during the early survivorship phase .

Claim
exercise interventions commenced in the early survivorship phase appear safe , feasible and may lead to improvements in qol and fatigue .

Premise

symptoms and qol seem not to be significantly affected by gkrs .

Premise
epoetin alfa avoided the decrease in hemoglobin level ( no decrease in the epoetin alfa group vs - 2 . 20g / dl change for the control group ; p < . 001 ) and statistically significantly reduced the percentage of subjects requiring red blood cell transfusion ( 12 . 8 % vs 28 . 1 % ; p < . 0001 ) .

Premise
the incidence of thrombotic events was 7 % in the epoetin alfa arm vs 3 % in the control arm .

Claim
epoetin alfa resulted in improved hemoglobin levels and decreased transfusions without an impact on relapse - free or overall survival .

however , epoetin alfa had an adverse effect , resulting in increased thrombosis .

Premise
pfs was similar in the two arms [ hr : xp vs . ep : 1 . 012 ( 95 % ci 0 . 785 - 1 . 304 ) ; median 10 . 4 months xp vs . 9 . 2 months ep ] .

Premise
overall survival was also similar [ hr 1 . 027 ( 95 % ci 0 . 740 - 1 . 424 ) ; median 22 . 0 vs . 26 . 1 months ] , and response rate was 47 % versus 42 % .

morbidity is an important issue in cancer research .

Claim
the observer - based toxicity scoring system used by dahanca ( the danish head and neck cancer study group ) has proved itself sensitive to differences in toxicity in a large randomised study ,

Claim
but like other toxicity scoring systems it has not been formally validated .

Premise
the conceptually similar endpoints of the two methods correlated significantly .

Premise
the dahanca toxicity scores had a low sensitivity ( 0 . 48 - 0 . 74 ) in detecting equivalent subjective complaints from the questionnaires and the observer - based scoring system severely underestimated patient complaints .

Premise
a specific patient group where the dahanca score had a higher tendency to fail could not be detected .

Claim
the dahanca toxicity score is an effective instrument in assessing objective treatment induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients but insensitive and non - specific with regard to patient assessed subjective endpoints .

Claim
this weakness seems inherent in an observer - based scoring system , and will probably also apply to newer ones like ctcae 3 . 0 .

Premise
the overall response rate was 8 . 4 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] ) 3 . 2 % to 13 . 7 % for patients treated with pvi 5 - fu alone compared with 17 . 6 % ; 95 % ci 10 . 3 % to 25 . 1 % for pvi 5 - fu plus mmc ( p = . 04 ) .

Premise
median failure - free survival was 2 . 8 months for pvi 5 - fu and 3 . 8 months for pvi 5 - fu plus mmc ( p = . 14 ) .

Premise
median survival was 5 . 1 months for pvi 5 - fu and 6 . 5 months for pvi 5 - fu plus mmc ( p = . 34 ) .

Premise
toxicities in both arms were mild .

Premise
there was an increased incidence of neutropenia in the 5 - fu plus mmc arm ( p < . 01 ) , although no differences in infection were seen .

Premise
no patients developed hemolytic uremic syndrome .

Premise
although there was no statistically significant difference in qol between arms .

Claim
pvi 5 - fu plus mmc resulted in a superior response rate in comparison with pvi 5 - fu alone in advanced pancreatic cancer ,

Claim
but this did not translate into a survival advantage .

Claim
these results emphasize the importance of chemotherapy in this setting and the continuing value of the fluoropyrimidines in pancreatic cancer .

Claim
research suggests that stress - reduction programs tailored to the cancer setting help patients cope with the effects of treatment and improve their quality of life .

Premise
patients in the ty group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow - up compared with patients in the wait - list control group ( 5 . 8 vs . 8 . 1 ; p < 0 . 004 ) .

Premise
this included better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0 . 02 ) , faster sleep latency ( p < 0 . 01 ) , longer sleep duration ( p < 0 . 03 ) , and less use of sleep medications ( p < 0 . 02 ) .

Premise
there were no significant differences between groups in terms of intrusion or avoidance , state anxiety , depression , or fatigue .

Claim
the participation rates suggested that a ty program is feasible for patients with cancer and that such a program significantly improves sleep - related outcomes .

Premise
however , there were no significant differences between groups for the other outcomes .

Claim
bone metastases occur in most women with advanced breast cancer and can lead to considerable morbidity and a rapid deterioration in the patient ' s quality of life .

Premise
compared with baseline measurements , the bone pain score was increased at the last assessment in both the placebo and 2 mg ibandronate groups ,

Premise
but was significantly reduced in the patients receiving 6 mg ibandronate ( - 0 . 28 + / - 1 . 11 , p < 0 . 001 ) .

Premise
a significant improvement in quality of life was demonstrated for patients treated with ibandronate ( p < 0 . 05 ) for all global health status .

Premise
overall , at the last assessment , the 6 mg ibandronate group showed significantly better functioning compared with placebo ( p = 0 . 004 ) , and had significantly better scores on the domains of physical , emotional , and social functioning , and in global health status ( p < 0 . 05 ) .

Premise
significant improvements in the symptoms of fatigue and pain were also observed in the 6 mg ibandronate group .

Claim
ibandronate treatment leads to significant improvements in quality of life , and is an effective and well - tolerated palliative treatment in patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer .

Claim
advice to rest and take things easy if patients become fatigued during radiotherapy may be detrimental .

Premise
there were no significant between group differences noted with regard to fatigue scores at baseline ( p = 0 . 55 ) or after 4 weeks of radiotherapy ( p = 0 . 18 ) .

Premise
men in the control group had significant increases in fatigue scores from baseline to the end of radiotherapy ( p = 0 . 013 ) , with no significant increases observed in the exercise group ( p = 0 . 203 ) .

Premise
a nonsignificant reduction ( 2 . 4 % ) in shuttle test distance at the end of radiotherapy was observed in the control group ; however , in the exercise group , there was a significant increase ( 13 . 2 % ) in distance walked ( p = 0 . 0003 ) .

Premise
men who followed advice to rest and take things easy if they became fatigued demonstrated a slight deterioration in physical functioning and a significant increase in fatigue at the end of radiotherapy .

Claim
home - based , moderate - intensity walking produced a significant improvement in physical functioning with no significant increase in fatigue .

Claim
improved physical functioning may be necessary to combat radiation fatigue .

Premise
peak oxygen consumption increased by 0 . 24 l / min in the exercise group ,

Premise
whereas it decreased by 0 . 05 l / min in the control group ( mean difference , 0 . 29 l / min ; 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 0 . 18 to 0 . 40 ; p < . 001 ) .

Premise
overall qol increased by 9 . 1 points in the exercise group compared with 0 . 3 points in the control group ( mean difference , 8 . 8 points ; 95 % ci , 3 . 6 to 14 . 0 ; p = . 001 ) .

Premise
pearson correlations indicated that change in peak oxygen consumption correlated with change in overall qol ( r = 0 . 45 ; p < . 01 ) .

Claim
exercise training had beneficial effects on cardiopulmonary function and qol in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors .

Premise

improvement of all primary cancer - and anemia - specific qol domains , including energy level , ability to do daily activities , and fatigue , was significantly ( p < . 01 ) greater for epoetin alfa versus placebo patients .

Premise
kaplan - meier estimates showed a trend in overall survival favoring epoetin alfa ( p = . 13 , log - rank test ) ,

Premise
cox regression analysis showed an estimated hazards ratio of 1 . 309 ( p = . 052 ) favoring epoetin alfa .

Premise
adverse events were comparable between groups .

Claim
epoetin alfa safely and effectively ameliorates anemia and significantly improves qol in cancer patients receiving nonplatinum chemotherapy .

Claim
encouraging results regarding increased survival warrant another trial designed to confirm these findings .

Premise
in 389 eligible patients , the relative dose intensities ( rdis ) of cyclophosphamide ( median , 96 . 3 % v 93 . 9 % ; p = . 01 ) and doxorubicin ( median , 95 . 4 % v 93 . 3 % ; p = . 04 ) were higher in patients treated with chop plus g - csf .

Premise
the complete response rates were 55 % and 52 % for chop and chop plus g - csf , respectively ( p = . 63 ) .

Premise
the actuarial overall survival at 5 years was 22 % with chop alone , compared with 24 % with chop plus g - csf ( p = . 76 ) , with a median follow - up of 33 months .

Premise
